# CNN Tutorial for Butterfly Image Classification

This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification using a unique Butterfly Species Classification dataset. The tutorial is structured as a Jupyter Notebook and covers:

- An explanation of CNN layers (Convolution, Pooling, Fully Connected layers)
- How CNNs extract image features compared to traditional ML methods
- Implementation of an image classification model from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras
- Transfer learning using a pre-trained VGG16 model with fine-tuning
- A comparison between a simple fully connected model and a CNN
